Question: 
A Content Management System(CMS) is an application used to manage different types of web content allowing multiple contributors to create, edit and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates.

The following are the basic features of a CMS:
Content creation (allows users to easily create and format content)
Content storage (stores content in one place, in a consistent fashion)
Workflow management (assigns privileges and responsibilities based on roles such as authors, editors and admins)
Publishing (organises and pushes content live)

Your task is to implement a barebones version of a CMS.

Features:
User should have the register and login (use auth-service we have already built)
All subsequent API calls from the front-end should be authenticated (use auth-service we have already built)
Create a content type and dynamically update it
Create data for a given content type
Get all data of a given content type

Points to note:
1. Do not cheat/lie
2. Can use google/co-pilot
3. Working code > Non-working, well modularised code, tested code
